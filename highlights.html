									<h2>Smart India Hackathon 2020 - 'GRAND FINALIST'- Shortlisted by ISRO - TOP 10%</h2>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/sih2020.PNG" alt="" /></span>

									<p> Smart India Hackathon is the largest national level hackathon in India. 
                                        It provides students from various colleges/institutes across India a platform to solve 
                                        some of the pressing problems we face in our daily lives,
                                        and thus inculcate a culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem solving.</p>
                                          
                                    <p>Problem statements from various government departments, PSUs, industries and NGOs are posted.
                                        Team leads are supposed to register along with their team to participate. 
                                        We chose a problem posted by the 'Indian Space Research Organization'- Processing, visualization and application development of raw
                                        GNSS data on Android smartphones. We cleared the university level 'internal hackathon' and proceeded 
                                        towards submitting our idea to ISRO. 
                                        Our solution proposal was shortlisted and we were amongst the top 10% of the teams 
                                        to be selected, thereby going straight to the 'Grand Finale'. 
                                    </p>

									<h2>Innovation Marathon 2019, Inventivepreneur Foundation – Shortlisted in TOP 3</h2>
                                    <p>Center for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE), NIIT University 
                                        in collaboration with the Inventivepreneur foundation had organized an ideathon involving
                                    funding to be provided to the top selected teams. Our team was one of them. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We proposed a solution for bridging the gap between the government and the general public
                                        in the form of an Android application. Our idea was to make an app which allows the public to
                                        post local issues where government assistance is needed. Issues could be upvoted in order to be 
                                        pinned at the top and to be brought primary attention to. Issues could also be reported in order to avoid fake reports.
                                        Respective government agencies can monitor this activity and resolve accordingly. 
                                        This idea promotes transparency and allows the government and the public to be on the same page.
                                    </p>

                                        success does not come easy. I maintain my body fitness which helps me focus more and
                                        gives me the strength to get on my toes and achieve new milestones.
